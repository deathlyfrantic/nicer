## Nicer

This is a very work-in-progress (possibly abandoned) IRC client using Electron,
React, Redux and Flow. Basic functionality works but it should not be used in
any serious way; the entire project could change at any time.

I am by no means an expert in any of the technologies used so the code may be
garbage.

Have fun.
